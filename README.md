# primitif-web

This web app is a lottery combination generator. Set a min, max number, and the amount of numbers to draw and generate random combinations. You can choose from some Lottery presets. Combinations are saved to your browser's localStorage and can be downloaded as CSV.

This project was used to test Vite + Vue 3 using TypeScript, with `<script setup>` and Composition API, as well as [VueI18N](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) for localization, [pinia](https://github.com/posva/pinia) as a Store, and [unplugin-icons](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-icons) for the icons.
